# Document Scanner
Why do you need this SW algorithm?
- You don't have a scanner at home.
- You want to scan a paper with a phone camera.
- Commercial scanner applications ask you to pay a fee or put a logo on your professional paper.
- Scanned paper shows dirts or crumples. (I've tried 5 times to get a clean scanning result but failed)

## How does it works?

It works like a camera scanner with the process below.

1. Preprocessing and Contour Detection

2. Contour Approximation

3. Perspective Transformation
